! Description    : Uses the ZSR approach to estimate the water content of an
!                  aerosol.  Simply put, the ZSR approach requires that the
!                  user determine a set of electrolyte moles/kg air, which, when
!                  dissociated, would give rise to the same moles/kg air of
!                  ions as is present in the aerosol.  The ZSR formula then states:
!                    Lw = Sum   { [Moles/(kg air) of the i'th electrolyte] / [Molality
!                  of the i'th electrolyte at the same water activity as the
!                  aerosol solution ] }.  Lw is the liquid water content,
!                  in kg water / kg air.  Unfortunately, more than one combination of
!                  electrolytes is possible, and more than one possible set of ions from each
!                  electrolyte is possible.  Information from Seinfeld's group (Seinfeld,
!                  personal communication, 2000) suggests that the resulting variations in
!                  aerosol water content are usually not significant.  This routine uses
!                  the following methodology for determining the moles electrolyte/ kg air from
!                  the moles ion/kg air:
!                    (1)  Number of moles of letovicite (NH4)3H(SO4)2 is taken from
!                    the smallest of the number of moles of SO4=, 1/3 of the NH4-,
!                    or half of the HSO4-.  The last is to allow some partitioning between
!                    ammonium bisulphate and letovicite for the HSO4- ions.
!
!                    (2)  Number of moles of ammonium bisulphate (NH4HSO4) is taken from
!                    the smallest of the number of moles of the remaining HSO4- and NH4+.
!
!                    (3)  Number of moles of ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4 is taken from the
!                    smallest of the number of half of the remaining moles of NH4+, and
!                    the remaining moles of SO4=.
!
!                    (4)  Number of moles of ammonium nitrate NH4NO3 is taken from the
!                    smallest of the number of remaining moles of NH4+ and NO3-.
!
!                    (5)  Number of moles of H2SO4 is taken from the minimum of the
!                    remaining number of moles of SO4= and half of the remaining moles of
!                    H+.
!
!                    (6)  Number of moles of H2SO4 is increased by the minimum of any
!                    remaining HSO4- and the remaining H+.
!
!                    (7)  Number of moles of HNO3 is taken from the minimum of the remaining
!                    number of moles of H+ and NO3-.
!
!                   Note:  the above priority was taken due to the following reasons:
!                    (a)  Ammonium nitrate and HNO3 are not found in solution unless there
!                   is sufficient NH4+ to neutralize the aerosol.  Therefore, the attempt is
!                   made to use up the ammonium on sulphate electrolytes before attempting
!                   to create ammonium nitrate.
!                    (b)  Letovicite and ammonium bisulphate are assumed to be both low in
!                   magnitude compared to ammonium sulphate, and (here, for the purposes
!                   of partitioning the ion moles) the bisulphate ion is not assumed
!                   to partion further into SO4= and H+.  The equilibrium between HSO4- and
!                   SO4=, maintained in the rest of the code, will ensure that HSO4- is
!                   relatively low and hence the water content attributed to letovicite and
!                   ammonium bisulphate will be relatively low.
!                   (c)  H2SO4 is given priority over HNO3 formation, since the latter is
!                   unlikely to form in significant quantities in the presence of the former
!                   (based on gamma values for HNO3 entering aerosols, in DeMore et al., 1997).
!                  Important note:  The ZSR technique, lacking a unique solution to the water
!                  content problem, should be compared to measurements at the first
!                  available opportunity.
!
! Extra info     :  Set minimum possible liquid water content of aerosols:
!                   Note that this value corresponds to 1.5E-10 ppbv H2O on a molar
!                   basis, while the US standard atmosphere's water profile
!                   has lower limit of 0.1 ppmv up into the stratosphere.
!                   A lower limit is necessary to prevent division by zero errors
!                   in the case of very low water concentrations.

!  Note that the working (w) ion arrays above may have leftover mass,
!  which could not be combined into electrolytes.  These arrays may
!  be written out for statistical purposes, if desired.
!  The moles/kg of electrolytes can now be used to calculate water content,
!  using the ZSR formula.  Lw = sum  of M/m0(i, aw), where
!  M is the number of moles/(kg air) of the i'th electrolyte in the aerosol
!  solution, and m0(i, aw) is the number of moles /(kg water) in a solution
!  having the same water activity as the mixture but composed solely of
!  electrolyte i.
!  The formulae for the terms in the denominator resulted from using
!  Excel to create polynomials for m as a function of aw from formulae
!  for aw as a function of m.  The latter formula came from the following
